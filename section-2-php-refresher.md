## The Command Line

In this lecture, we explored the command line. Before interfaces existed, everything we wanted to do was done through the command line, such as sending emails, downloading files, or playing audio. Developers prefer the command line since a user interface can bog down the performance. Most tools are only executable through the command line.

You can open the command line by searching for a program called **Terminal** on a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine.

There are dozens of commands available. Luckily, it's not required to be a master of the command line. You can get away with the following commands:

* `pwd` - Short for **Present Working Directory**. This command will output the full path you're currently in.
* `ls` - Short for **List**. This command will output a full list of files and folders that are in the current directory.
* `cd` - Short for **Change Directory**. This command will change the current directory. You can use two dots (`..`) to back up a directory instead of moving into a directory.
* `clear` - Clears the command line.

In Visual Studio Code, you can open the command line by going to **Terminal > New Terminal**. By default, the command line will point to your project directory, which can make things easier. This saves you time from moving the command line to your project.
